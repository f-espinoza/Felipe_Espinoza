## Project 1: [Death in Chile 2016 - 2021(I)](https://www.kaggle.com/felipeea/death-in-chile-2016-2021-i) 
Kaggle Notebook showing a data exploration with Python of a dataset containing data about date, primary cause of death, and numerous other information about death in Chile from 2016 to 2021.
With this data I was able to answer various questions:

1. What was the first cause of death in 2021 in Chile?
2. What were the top five causes of death in Chile in 2021, each year since 2016, and accumulated?
3. What is the most common cause of death by region?
4. Is there any difference between the causes of death for men and women?
5. What is the main cause of death among children of 3 and under?
6. Evolution of deaths caused by COVID disease (2020-2021)


The data source was the chilean Department of Statistics and Health Information. The dataset can be found [here](https://deis.minsal.cl/#datosabiertos)


## Project 2: [Energy production, trade and consumption](https://github.com/f-espinoza/portfolio/blob/main/SQL/un_energy_dataset/SQL_data_exploration_energy_un.sql) 
SQL data exploration of the an *Energy, production, trade and consumption* database. With this exploration I was able understand this dataset with insights like:

1. Compare the Energy supply per capita in gigajoules between South America, North America and Europe.
2. The average primary energy production in the world.
3. Percentage difference between the country with the lowest energy suppply per capita and the rest in a list containing: Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.  
4. Seeing the evoution of energy productionm in Germany and comparing it with the Russian Federation.
